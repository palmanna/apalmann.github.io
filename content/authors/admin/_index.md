## About Me

I am a PhD Candidate at the Institute for Logic, Language and Computation at the University of Amsterdam. As part of the research consortium "Language Science for Social Good" I am investigating multimodal communication in people with auditory impairments. For this, I am using kinematic analyses combined with speech analyses of naturalistic dialogues as well as EEG. In my free time, I enjoy traveling the world with my bicycle or by hitchhiking. This presents a great opportunity for me to learn new languages and through that get a glimpse into different cultures beyond the academic world. Besides that, I am involved in various cooking projects aiming to reduce food waste. I am curious, critical, and genuinely interested in (almost) everything.
